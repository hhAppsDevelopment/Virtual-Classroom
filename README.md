# Virtual Classroom
## The concept
This project allows students to create, and then log in to users, in which they can find tests and questions (written by the teacher) that they need to answer.
The programme also allows teachers to sign in but they need to have pre-created user accounts.
## The project
This project is the final product of our mentoring efforts, created by a student in their last grade, just before graduating secondary school.
## Known issues
1. Cannot create teacher account (due to security concern, awaiting solution)
2. Some exceptions are not handled, application is easy to crash
3. Lacking revision of the UI, not too user-friendly

## To try it out
As there is no executable file of any kind, you need to compile and run them yourself.
